# Breakify

## Background

Numerous Singaporeans adopt a ‘rise and grind’ mentality, deeply ingraining this practice within its society’s values. Locally, 50% of employees have reported feeling burnt out from work, while 41% have their thoughts preoccupied with work even after hours. This ‘hustle culture’ has birthed a social stigma against taking breaks, for both students and working adults alike. Additionally, many Singaporeans do not prioritize their mental health: living in a country rooted in traditional Asian values, seeking avenues to improve one’s mental health is uncommon. Lastly, many Singaporeans are unaware of where to seek help for mental health. Only 43% believe that local healthcare systems actually treat mental health. From personal experience, we have also felt pressured to work consistently for the entire day, with few breaks in between long sessions of work, which often results in pains in the lower back and neck regions.

## Overview

Being students ourselves, we felt that this was an important problem which required our attention. This led to the birth of Breakify, a one-stop platform  primarily targetted at students and working adults to help keep track of their work and rest schedules. Breakify aims to allievate these pains by helping the user keep track of the time that they are working, and remind them to take breaks through the day. Breakify uses a recommendation model to tailor one's work-rest cycle based on past user data. This ensures optimal work and rest timings to aid the user in functioning at his/her peak. 

## Core Functionality

### Break - Work Timer


### Social and Meetups


### Activities




Breakify also incorporates the social element by showing other friends who are on breaks as well. The user can then simply click on the name of their friend to set up a meet with them.

Breakify also features a walk feature, which uses the Google Maps API to generate a walking route to a notable landmark based on a user-specified duration.
